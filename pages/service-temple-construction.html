            Theories and Principles of Indian Temple Construction
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Before we go any further, it will be worthwhile to examine the
            principles that guided the Hindu Temple architect and mason. How was
            there a proliferation of high-quality work in throughout the
            country? Was it a spontaneous expression of creative energy or were
            there some basic rules to follow, some essential unity underlying
            the apparent diversity? We shall examine briefly the social,
            religious, metaphysical and material factors that led to the
            production of Indian temples.

        <div class="text-container">
          <h4 class="display-6 main-text">Supremacy of the Brahmins</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since the decline of the Gupta dynasty to the age of the Mughals,
            there was no central political authority through most of India. This
            political vacuum was filled by the priestly class, who gradually
            assumed power as the sole arbiters of almost every aspect of life -
            birth, death, puberty, marriage, business and personal. All these
            'favors', of course, had a price and those on whose behalf they
            <span class="imp-text">'generously'</span> interceded with the gods
            would pay the priests by cash or in kind.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Obviously the serious business of construction was too important to
            be overlooked either. While the basic concepts of construction and
            decoration had already been evolved, it was the Brahmins who began
            erecting a complex edifice of rules and layouts for different
            classes of building. These were purposely couched in hideously
            complicated mumbo-jumbo - the better to be well beyond the ken of
            the common man or even an ordinary craftsman. A lifetime was
            required to study the rules and more, if possible.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            These rules sometimes assumed ridiculous dimensions. The most basic
            acts of building were no longer to be based on technical
            considerations but rather on mythological ones. Thus the
            Vastushastra was sometimes more of a hindrance than a help to the
            craftsmen.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It is in this situation that the genius of the Indian Craftsman came
            to the fore. In a situation that could easily have been stifling,
            the mason and stonecutters came forth and created beauty simply by
            the plasticity of their sculpture and the sheer brute force of their
            forms. A large part of this was due to the institution of Senis or
            guilds, about which a brief mention has been made in a previous
            article.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
          <h4 class="display-6 main-text">Senis - Protectors of Heritage</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            As early as the 7th century B.C., Indian craftsmen had organized
            themselves into guilds, the better to protect their special
            knowledge, and to gain for themselves better working conditions, and
            finally to ensure a minimum standard of quality of workmanship.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the senis, heredity was the route by which traditional knowledge
            was passed on through the generations. As soon as a boy was old
            enough to hold tools, he was set to work on a rough block of stone
            and so commenced his long apprenticeship. This was the father's sole
            gift and heirloom to his sons who in turn ensured that his name and
            style would live on.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A temple project would often be of such magnitude that more than one
            generation of master cutters and masons would be required to finish
            it. So a clan of stonecutters would settle around the building site
            for years. The temple site attracted young men hoping to learn as
            well as find work. Thus it became the focus of activity for miles
            around. Over the years, regional variations introduced for the
            building of a particular temple led to the evolution of a new style
            or 'school' of temple building, much like the gharanas that exist in
            Indian classical music even today. Hence we find distinct schools of
            art and architecture even within North Indian temple construction -
            the Orissan, Chalukyan, Gujarati, Kashmiri, and of course, the same
            situation in the temples of the south, which were further divided
            into many regional variations and schools of construction. In all
            these the Vastushastra was the giver of cohesiveness, which ensured
            overall similarity of form and function, but also, as we have seen,
            was responsible for fettering the imagination of the craftsmen.

            The Magic of the VastuPurushaMandala

            Looking at Hindu temples, it is not very easy to discern that they
            are composed of one repeating unit - the square. For God's own
            abode, the form had to be perfect and this limited the choice of
            shapes to the circle - a form without beginning and end, and the
            square - perfect for its symmetry. The circle had already been
            extensively used by the Buddhists in their Stupas and moreover, was
            perceived to be too dynamic a form for the resting place of the
            gods. For the Hindus, their gods had to be installed in buildings
            symbolizing unity, inertia and permanence. The square, thus, was
            chosen for these qualities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="img-responsive">

        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
          <p>
            This was the origin of the square Mandala (the best translation of
            this in English is 'divine chart'). The mandala was further
            subdivided into smaller squares in a grid, those containing 64 or 81
            being the most common. Each of these smaller squares was then
            invested with a resident deity, each with his own special attributes
            and powers. The distance of the deities from the center was
            according to their power and perceived importance.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thus Brahma, the creator, occupied pride of place in the center and
            lesser gods were relegated to the edges. A humanistic façade was
            given to the square by showing it to be able to accommodate a figure
            in a convoluted yogic posture.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            It is interesting to note that this idea, that of the human figure
            being the basis of a system of proportion, was also used in the
            European Renaissance by Leonardo de Vinci, and later by Le
            Corbusier, planner of Chandigarh in India, in his Modular system of
            measurement.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thus, having acquired magical and theological properties, the
            VastuPurushaMandala was fit to be the basis of temple construction,
            with many permutations and combinations being used to achieve the
            final form.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Very simply, the central square could be used for the garba-griha,
            while the surrounding grid formed the pradakshina-path and outer
            wall, and so on2
          </p>

        <div class="img-responsive">

        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
          <p>
            By increasing in complexity this system of proportion could spawn
            the most complex of forms with their basic unit remaining the
            square. It was by manipulation of this basic grid that the Indian
            architect created the greatest temples of India. The best examples,
            the glorious days of Hindu architecture, shall form the basis of our
            next article.
