          <p>
            Hindu temple architecture as the main form of Hindu architecture has
            many varieties of style, though the basic nature of the Hindu temple
            remains the same, with the essential feature an inner sanctum, the
            garbha griha or womb-chamber, where the primary Murti or the image
            of a deity is housed in a simple bare cell. Around this chamber
            there are often other structures and buildings, in the largest cases
            covering several acres. On the exterior, the garbhagriha is crowned
            by a tower-like shikhara, also called the vimana in the south. The
            shrine building often includes an circumambulatory passage for
            parikrama, a mandapa congregation hall, and sometimes an antarala
            antechamber and porch between garbhagriha and mandapa. There may
            further mandapas or other buildings, connected or detached, in large
            temples, together with other small temples in the compound
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Hindu temple architecture reflects a synthesis of arts, the ideals
            of dharma, beliefs, values and the way of life cherished under
            Hinduism. The temple is a place for Tirtha—pilgrimage. All the
            cosmic elements that create and celebrate life in Hindu pantheon,
            are present in a Hindu temple—from fire to water, from images of
            nature to deities, from the feminine to the masculine, from kama to
            artha, from the fleeting sounds and incense smells to Purusha—the
            eternal nothingness yet universality—is part of a Hindu temple
            architecture. The form and meanings of architectural elements in a
            Hindu temple are designed to function as the place where it is the
            link between man and the divine, to help his progress to spiritual
            knowledge and truth, his liberation it calls moksha.

            The architectural principles of Hindu temples in India are described
            in Shilpa Shastras and Vastu Sastras.[4][5] The Hindu culture has
            encouraged aesthetic independence to its temple builders, and its
            architects have sometimes exercised considerable flexibility in
            creative expression by adopting other perfect geometries and
            mathematical principles in Mandir construction to express the Hindu
            way of life.[6]

            The procedure for building a temple is extensively discussed, and it
            could be expressed in short as "Karshanadi Pratisthantam", meaning
            beginning with "Karshana" and ending with "Pratistha". The details
            of steps involved vary from one
            <span class="imp-text">Agama</span> to another, but broadly these
            are the steps in temple construction:

          <br />
          <p>
            From the proportions of the inner sanctum to the motifs carved into
            the pillars, the traditional temple takes its first form on the
            master <span class="imp-text">sthapati's</span> drawing board. The
            architect initially determines the fundamental unit of measurement
            using a formula called ayadhi. This formula, which comes from
            <span class="imp-text">Jyotisha</span>, or Vedic
            <span class="imp-text">astrology</span>, uses the nakshatra (birth
            star) of the founder, the nakshatra of the village in which the
            temple is being erected matching the first syllable of the name of
            the village with the seed sounds mystically associated with each
            nakshatra and the nakshatra of the main Deity of the temple. This
            measurement, called <span class="imp-text">danda</span>, is the
            dimension of the inside of the sanctum and the distance between the
            pillars. The whole space of the temple is defined in multiples and
            fractions of this basic unit.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Shastras are strict about the use of metals, such as iron in the
            temple structure because iron is mystically the crudest, most impure
            of metals. The presence of iron, sthapatis explain, could attract
            lower, impure forces. Only gold, silver, and copper are used in the
            structure, so that only the most sublime forces are invoked during
            the pujas. At especially significant stages in the temple
            construction (such as ground-breaking and placement of the sanctum
            door frame), pieces of gold, silver and copper, as well as precious
            gems, are ceremoniously embedded in small interstices between the
            stones, adding to the temple's inner-world magnetism. These elements
            are said to glow in the inner worlds and, like holy ash, are
            prominently visible to the Gods and Devas.

            The ground plan is described as a symbolic, miniature representation
            of the cosmos. It is based on a strict grid made up of squares and
            equilateral triangles which are imbued with deep religious
            significance. To the priest-architect the square was an absolute and
            mystical form. The grid, usually of 64 or 81 squares, is in fact a
            mandala, a model of the cosmos, with each square belonging to a
            deity. The position of the squares is in accordance with the
            importance attached to each of the deities, with the square in the
            center representing the temple deity; the outer squares cover the
            gods of lower rank. Agamas say that the temple architecture is
            similar to a man sitting - and the idol in garbagriha is exactly the
            heart-plexus, gopuram as the crown etc.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The construction of the temple follows in three dimensional form
            exactly the pattern laid out by the mandala. The relationship
            between the underlying symbolic order and the actual physical
            appearance of the temple can best be understood by seeing it from
            above which was of course impossible for humans until quite
            recently.

          <br />

            Another important aspect of the design of the ground plan is that it
            is intended to lead from the temporal world to the eternal. The
            principal shrine should face the rising sun and so should have its
            entrance to the east. Movement towards the sanctuary, along the
            east-west axis and through a series of increasingly sacred spaces is
            of great importance and is reflected in the architecture. A typical
            temple consists of the following major elements

            <li class="list-group-item">
              4. the tower build directly above the garbagriha.

            Significance of the number eight in temple design
          </h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Vastu Shastra describes the inner sanctum and main tower as a human
            form, structurally conceived in human proportions based on the
            mystical number eight. According to Dr. V.
            <span class="imp-text">Ganapati Sthapati</span>, Senior Architect at
            the Vastu Government College of Architecture, the vibration of the
            space-consciousness, which is called time, is the creative element,
            since it is this vibratory force that causes the energetic space to
            turn into spatial forms. Therefore, time is said to be the
            primordial element for the creation of the entire universe and all
            its material forms. When these vibrations occur rhythmically, the
            resultant product will be an orderly spatial form. This rhythm of
            the time unit is traditionally called talam or layam.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since every unit of time vibration produces a corresponding unit of
            space measure, vastu science derives that time is equal to space.
            This rhythm of
            <span class="imp-text">time and space</span> vibrations is
            quantified as eight and multiples of eight, the fundamental and
            universal unit of measure in the vastu silpa tradition. This theory
            carries over to the fundamental
            <span class="imp-text">adi</span> talam (eight beats) of classical
            Indian <span class="imp-text">music</span> and
            <span class="imp-text">dance</span>. Applying this in the creation
            of a human form, it is found that a human form is also composed of
            rhythmic spatial units. According to the Vastu Shastras, at the
            subtle level the human form is a structure of eight spatial units
            devoid of the minor parts like the hair, neck, kneecap and feet,
            each of which measures one-quarter of the basic measure of the body
            and, when added on to the body's eight units, increases the height
            of the total form to nine units. Traditionally these nine units are
            applied in making sculptures of Gods.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Since the subtle space within our body is part of universal space,
            it is logical to say that the talam of our inner space should be the
            same as that of the universe. But in reality, it is very rare to
            find this consonance between an individual's and the universal
            rhythm. When this consonance occurs, the person is in harmony with
            the Universal Being and enjoys spiritual strength, peace and bliss.
            Therefore, when designing a building according to vastu, the
            architect aims at creating a space that will elevate the vibration
            of the individual to resonate with the vibration of the built space,
            which in turn is in tune with universal space. Vastu architecture
            transmutes the individual rhythm of the indweller to the rhythm of
            the Universal Being.

            The goal of a temple's design is to bring about the descent or
            manifestation of the unmanifest and unseen. The architect or
            sthapati begins by drafting a square. The square is considered to be
            a fundamental form. It presupposes the circle and results from it.
            Expanding energy shapes the circle from the center; it is
            established in the shape of the square. The circle and curve belong
            to life in its growth and movement. The square is the mark of order,
            the finality to the expanding life, life's form and the perfection
            beyond life and death. From the square all requisite forms can be
            derived: the triangle, hexagon, octagon, circle etc. The architect
            calls this square the vastu-purusha-mandala-vastu, the manifest,
            purusha, the Cosmic Being, and mandala.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The vastu-purusha-mandala represents the manifest form of the Cosmic
            Being; upon which the temple is built and in whom the temple rests.
            The temple is situated in Him, comes from Him, and is a
            manifestation of Him. The vastu-purusha-mandala is both the body of
            the Cosmic Being and a bodily device by which those who have the
            requisite knowledge attain the best results in temple building.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In order to establish the vastu-purusha-mandala on a construction
            site, it is first drafted on planning sheets and later drawn upon
            the earth at the actual building site. The drawing of the mandala
            upon the earth at the commencement of construction is a sacred rite.
            The rites and execution of the vastu-purusha-mandala sustain the
            temple in a manner similar to how the physical foundation supports
            the weight of the building.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Based on astrological calculations the border of the
            vastu-purusha-mandala is subdivided into thirty-two smaller squares
            called nakshatras. The number thirty-two geometrically results from
            a repeated division of the border of the single square. It denotes
            four times the eight positions in space: north, east, south, west,
            and their intermediate points. The closed polygon of thirty-two
            squares symbolizes the recurrent cycles of time as calculated by the
            movements of the moon. Each of the nakshatras is ruled over by a
            Deva, which extends its influence to the mandala. Outside the
            mandala lie the four directions, symbolic of the meeting of heaven
            and earth and also represent the ecliptic of the sun-east to west
            and its rotation to the northern and southern hemispheres.
